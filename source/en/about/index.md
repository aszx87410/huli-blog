Hey, I am Huli from Taiwan. I was a Front-end engineer before, and now a Security Engineer interested in web. 

I love coding, teaching and writing blog posts, and I believe sharing can make the world a better place. I also play CTF sometimes with [Water Paddler](https://twitter.com/Water_Paddler).
